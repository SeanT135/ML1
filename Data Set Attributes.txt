0) The binary result of quality assessment. 0 = bad quality 1 = sufficient quality.

	Whether image has certain quality. Will likely remove all bad quality from dataset.

1) The binary result of pre-screening, where 1 indicates severe retinal abnormality and 0 its lack.

	Prescreening for abnormality. Any without are likely not to have DR. Will likely remove all lacking images from dataset.

2-7) The results of MA detection. Each feature value stand for the number of MAs found at the confidence levels alpha = 0.5, . . . , 1, respectively.

	MA: Microaneurysms

8-15) contain the same information as 2-7) for exudates. However, as exudates are represented by a set of points rather than the number of pixels constructing the lesions, these features are normalized by dividing the number of lesions with the diameter of the region of interest to compensate different image sizes.

	Exudates: Leakage of a fluid composed of serum, fibrin, and white blood cells.
	ROI: Region of Interest

16) The euclidean distance of the center of the macula and the center of the optic disc to provide important information regarding the patient's condition. This feature
is also normalized with the diameter of the ROI.

	Euclidean distance: "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
	Macula: most sensitive spot in the center of the retina, responsible for our central vision and color vision.

17) The diameter of the optic disc.

	Optic disc: Area of the retina without cone or rod cells, where the optic nerve leaves the eyeball.

18) The binary result of the AM/FM-based classification.

	AM/FM: Amplitude-modulation frequency-modulation method of identification

19) Class label. 1 = contains signs of DR (Accumulative label for the Messidor classes 1, 2, 3), 0 = no signs of DR.

	Messidor Classes:

		0 (Normal): (μA = 0) AND (H = 0)
		1: (0 < μA <= 5) AND (H = 0)
		2: ((5 < μA < 15) OR (0 < H < 5)) AND (NV = 0)
		3: (μA >= 15) OR (H >=5) OR (NV = 1)

		μA: number of microaneurysms
		H: number of hemorrhages
		NV = 1: neovascularization
		NV = 0: no neovascularization

	Neovascularization: Production of new blood vessels dude to lowered bloodflow in an area
